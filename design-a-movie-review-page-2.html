        <h1>Movie Review: Final Destination Bloodlines</h1>
        <img src="https://img.megaplextheatres.com/FilmBackdrop/HO00003748" width="450" alt="Poster for Final Destination: Bloodlines showing a skull facing upward, mouth open, hanging by its nose from a metal chain. The background is dim with soft red, yellow, and purple lighting that reflects onto the skull. An 'open' sign glows in the top right, contributing to the red light. The colorful glow fades into darkness around the edges of the poster." />
        <p>Final Destination Bloodlines brings us back to everyone’s favorite Rube Goldberg machine of doom. This time, our unlucky lead Riley Morgan has a vision and saves his friends from a freak hot-air balloon accident (yes, really). But Death, the world’s most persistent party crasher, is not pleased. As always, the survivors drop like flies in increasingly absurd and overly complicated ways that make you wonder if Death missed its true calling as a mad engineer. With help from a sarcastic med student and a traumatized aunt who has definitely seen some things, Riley tries to outwit fate which, as usual, goes exactly as well as you’d expect in a Final Destination movie. It’s gory, it’s tense, and it’s also kind of hilarious.</p>
